      <p>This is a site for my thesis. Please check out the songs I have been working on writing over the past year. Some are good, some are bad, some are weird. All of them made me a better songwriter.</p>

        <p>The Night sweeps over And I drive slower Past the curves in the road Sunset leading me on</p>

        <p>And I’m reminded of the streams of watercolor paints swirling together when poured out In the drain to wash out the remains of creation And they become beautiful Without intention</p>

        <p>Into the sink the art is all its own Into the sink the art is all its own</p>

        <p>I’ll come home soon I’m missing you I’ll come home soon I’m missing you</p>

        <p>It’s good to be back here With my feet in the sand I grew up on salt air</p>

        <p>You remind me of inhalations building towering waves that sweep life off its feet and just wash it away into its chest it pulls it all before the crashing crest</p>

        <p>the dark water is a gamble but I am not alone and so Into the sea I wade, towards my first love</p>
        <p>I’ll come home soon I’m missing you I’ll come home soon I’m missing you</p>

        <p>You remind me of inhalations building towering waves that sweep life off its feet with no regard for species Or genus or order or color or size pull it all before the sand and water collide Into the sea I wade, for I have always been in love Into the sea I wade, for I am not alone Into the sea I wade, towards my first love Into the sea I wade, for I have always been in love

        You wonder what is next
        how could you possibly go on
        You know you have it in you
        but it seems to be hidden
        
        you aren't left with nothing
        but it's ok to be angry
        don't bottle it up or cover it up
        feel all your heart is saying
        
        just give yourself some grace
        be gentle with yourself
        give some grace
        get home safe
        just take care</div>

    <div class= "lyrics">
Sometimes it surprises me
how much she loves to dance
how she holds her balance
How she cooks with he two hands
        
        She's the one that's there for me
        when I feel most alone
        'cuz my body is all that I have
        when I'm walking through this world
        
Seasons change and money drains
And people come and go
But my body and me are on one team
My body and me whoa whoa 
        
Sometimes she will fail me
Sometimes she will run too slow
could never do a cartwheel
She won’t fit into small clothes
Even when it’s hard
I need to keep on loving her 
because my body is all that i have
When im walking through this world

Seasons change and money drains
And people come and go
But my body and me are on one team
My body and me whoa whoa 

Through the darkest parts of my life
She’ll be the one to carry me
She’ll be with me forever
Like nothing else could be

Loyalty is never infinite
And time wears on the soul
But my body is all that i have
When im walking through this world

Seasons change and money drains
And people come and go
But my body and me are on one team
My body and me whoa whoa 

Seasons change and money drains
And people come and go
But my body and me are on one team
My body and me whoa whoa

    <button class= "title" id="4">Gaslight</button>
    <div class= "lyrics">If i tell myself it’s not that bad,
It means I overreacted
It means I’m just fragile

Because when I closed the door when you had gone
I wasn't sure what had gone on
Thought I might just be fragile
        
And I turn the gaslight on again
To show myself it was an illusion
I’m wrong for thinking I was wronged
I should calm down
Should just calm down

If I admit it was that bad
It means I was really hurt like that
And I don’t want to be broken

I want to think the best of us
But I think you might have fucked that up 
And now i’m probably broken

I turn the gaslight on again
To show myself it was an illusion
I’m wrong for thinking I was wronged
I should calm down
Should just calm down

And I turn the gaslight on again
Desperate for my old illusion
I've forgotten what is right and wrong
I should calm down
You baby, calm down
