        <p>The Night sweeps over And I drive slower Past the curves in the road Sunset leading me on</p>

        <p>And I’m reminded of the streams of watercolor paints swirling together when poured out In the drain to wash out the remains of creation And they become beautiful Without intention</p>

        <p>Into the sink the art is all its own Into the sink the art is all its own</p>

        <p>I’ll come home soon I’m missing you I’ll come home soon I’m missing you</p>

        <p>It’s good to be back here With my feet in the sand I grew up on salt air</p>

        <p>You remind me of inhalations building towering waves that sweep life off its feet and just wash it away into its chest it pulls it all before the crashing crest</p>

        <p>the dark water is a gamble but I am not alone and so Into the sea I wade, towards my first love</p>
        <p>I’ll come home soon I’m missing you I’ll come home soon I’m missing you</p>

        <p>You remind me of inhalations building towering waves that sweep life off its feet with no regard for species Or genus or order or color or size pull it all before the sand and water collide Into the sea I wade, for I have always been in love Into the sea I wade, for I am not alone Into the sea I wade, towards my first love Into the sea I wade, for I have always been in love
